# HTML-Assignment1
First assignment of my HTML &amp; CSS course

Followed four wireframes making a simpler webpage. The webpage's logo needed to be linked to the homepage and the navbar had to have working links to every page. 
The code had to be syntactically and semantically correct and pass a W3C validation without warning or errors.
